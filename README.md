# -32-bit-Brent-Kung-Logarithmic-Adder-Circuit-using-VHDL
-> Designed an adder utilizing a Tree-Structure, leading to logarithmic time complexity for better efficiency.

-> Implemented AND, XOR, (A+B.C) logic to compute different order Generate and Propogate expressions.

-> Analyzed the structural description of each level of tree for generating final sum and carry output.

-> Implemented the design in VHDL using Quartus and verified with multiple test vectors in Modelsim.
